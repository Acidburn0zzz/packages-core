		-udev gained support for loading additional device properties from an 
		 indexed database that is keyed by vendor/product IDs and similar device identifiers. 
		 For the beginning this hwdb is populated with data from the well-known PCI and USB 
		 database, but also includes PNP, ACPI and OID data. In the longer run this indexed 
		 database shall grow into becoming the one central database for non-essential userspace 
		 device metadata. Previously, data from the PCI/USB database was only attached to select 
		 devices, since the lookup was a relatively expensive operation due to O(n) time complexity 
		 (with n being the number of entries in the database). Since this is now O(1), we decided 
		 to add in this data for all devices where this is available, by default. Note that the 
		 indexed database needs to be rebuilt when new data files are installed. To achieve this 
		 you need to update your packaging scripts to invoke udevadm
